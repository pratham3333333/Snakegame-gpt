## Overview

SnakeGame-GPT is a browser-based implementation of the classic Snake game. The twist? It‚Äôs themed or possibly integrated with GPT (e.g. in UI, naming, or interactions). It‚Äôs an engaging way to combine a fun game with AI branding / potential AI-backed features.

## How It Works / Architecture

1. **Game Loop**  
   A JavaScript main loop handles updates (movement, collision, growth) and rendering.  
2. **State Management**  
   The game tracks snake segments, direction, food position, score, game-over state.  
3. **Rendering**  
   Uses HTML5 Canvas (or DOM elements) to draw the grid, snake, food.  
4. **Input Handling**  
   Keyboard events (arrow keys) or touch/swipe for mobile controls.  
5. **Integration with GPT (if applicable)**  
   - Theming (GPT-inspired UI, messages)  
   - (Optional) Prompt-based insults / praises / hints using GPT  
   - (Optional) Chat or feedback interface  

*(If you‚Äôve added more advanced features like AI, hints, or GPT chat, describe them here.)*
